### Hi there 👋🐻


**I'm a bear lost in this new world.**

I will upload projects that I carry out, whether personal or work.

If anything I upload needs configuration, I will try in the best way possible to put on the project presentation page what steps must be followed, because I may have to delete the default one for privacy.

I know that there will be more than one thing that can still be improved in my code, which I would appreciate if you improve it, it would be changed here as well so that the next person to use it will have it better.

So I hope that what I upload will help you and I'm sorry for any possible errors.

**Greetings, your favorite bear :D**
